## Overview   

Kurosawa's [<b>Rashomon</b>](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042876/) challenged its viewers to puzzle over what they have seen. Four versions of a tragic event were presented, but each version had enough omissions and inconsistencies to alert the viewer that no version was the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Even the supposedly neutral observer freamed his version in a way to make himself look better. Some viewers concluded that the film's main point was that truth is unknowable. I'm not so pessimistic. To me the film is a reminder that truth is attainable but is rarely as simple as it first appears to be, and that multiple perspectives provide useful insights, even when they seem to be in conflict with each other.   

The four viewpoints presented in the following sections of this policy analysis are the perspectives that I encountered in my efforts to assemble data that would provide a broad context for productive discussions of diversity in the U.S. information technology sector.   

* [<b>Best States for American Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Female Tech – Vers 1.0f</b>](https://hbcu-levers.blogspot.com/2016/11/best-states-for-american-black-hispanic.html) 
* [<b>Foreign Professionals: U.S. Tech’s Other Pipelines – Version 1.0</b>](https://hbcu-levers.blogspot.com/2016/12/foreign-professionals-us-techs-other.html)   

Each view identifies solution strategies, but different views lead to different strategies.

## Version 1 -- Racism and Sexism   


Problem: low percentage women, Blacks, and Hispanics   
Cause: implicit bias   
Solutions: appoint diversity officers and diverse board members   
Flaw --- low levels in SV usual pipelines

<P style="page-break-before: always">   
## Version 2  -- Academic Pipelines   


Problem: low percentage women, Blacks, and Hispanics in tech
Cause: low percentage of women, Blacks, and Hispanics in academic pipelines that prepare students for careers in tech   
Solutions: Reform college and outreach to HBCUs at college level   
support Black Girls Code and other grass roots groups to encourage younger students ... substantial dollars to Code,org   
Flaw -- lots of Black and Hispanic techs, SV has small demand, why no recruitment efforts??? Why no concern about competitive disadvantages of low diversity??

## ... Comments -- Versions 1 and 2

* Little progress in Silicon Valley and the "explanation" of apologists "These things take time" is both ironic and unacceptable give the Valley's incessant self-praise about its capacity to "disrupt" and "fail fast"  

* My initial focus was on Black Techs, but my examination of data that showed substantial enrollments of Hispanic students in California's top schools removed all doubt that lack of employment in Silicon Valley was a reflection of of low supply levels in the Valley's pipelines

* Lack of progress suggest that neither perspective gets to the heart of the issue. Failure sometimes indicates that other actions of the actor are acting at cross purposes to the actor's stated goals   

* By the time I finished "Best States" I had acquired enough data about U,S, tech's extensive hiring of foreign techs to suspect that the increasing employment of these high tech migrant laborers might be the "cross purposes" initiative resopnsible for the lack of progress   

* As an aging Black techie who received his undergrad degree in engineering way back in 1962 from New York University, I find racial bias, conscious or unconscious, as implausible explanations of the Valley's lack of progress in increasing the percentage of Black technical staff on the Valley's payrolls. Why? Because there are too many Jewish Americans in the top management of the Valley's biggest and most successful companies.

<P style="page-break-before: always">   
## Version 3 -- Competitive Advantage  


Problem: Not enough U.S. techs with satisfactory tech skills   
Cause: Curriculum of U.S. colleges and universities not evolving fast enough to keep pace with evolving technologies required by U.S. tech   
Solution: import increasing numbers of foreign professionals to fill this skills gap, especially from Asia where training seems to be keeping pace with technology and cost of living is lower than in Europe, expand H-1B visa, ... broad scale immigration reform to give U.S. tech access to unlimited foreign labor   
Flaw -- Why is there no limit to foreign recruitment?

<P style="page-break-before: always">   
## Version 4 -- Maximum Profits   


Problem: U.S. Tech, especially software development, is still labor intensive   
In order to sustain record profits in order to attract future investments, labor costs must be reduced   
Classic solution -- use cheaper labor, i.e., techs from other countries with much lower standards of living, e.g, therefore mostly from Asian countriess   
Flaw -- Japan that can say no ... defense industrial base ... cost benefit for entire economy ... permanent low share for Black techs can't compete with cheap labor
