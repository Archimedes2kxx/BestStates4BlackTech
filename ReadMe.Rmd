This repo contains the data files, code books, and R code required to produce the statistics and graphics included in the "Best States for Blacks in Tech" report. It also contains the R-markdown code that generated the report, and it contains the report's HTML file produced by knitr's conversion of the R-markdown. In other words, the repo contains all of the resources required to make the report "reproducible" for anyone interested in replicating its findings and/or extending them to other states, adding/deleting variables, comparing them to census data from previous time frames, etc, etc, etc.

The scripts and their embedded functions should be run in numerical order -- Data-1 creates the dataframe required by StatsGraphs-2; and StatsGraphs-2 creates the statistics and graphics required by the Report-3 script.
