This repo contains the data files, code books, and R code required to produce the tables, maps, graphs, and stats included in the "Best States for Blacks and Hispanics in Tech" report. It also contains the R-markdown code that generated the report and knitr's conversion of the markdown to an HTML format. In other words, the repo should contain all of the resources required to make the report "reproducible" for anyone interested in replicating its findings and/or extending them to other states, adding/deleting variables, comparing them to census data from previous time frames, etc, etc, etc.

The scripts and their embedded functions should be run in numerical order: Data-1A, and Data-1B create the dataframes required by Stats-2; Stats-2 creates the objects required for the Report-3 R-markdown script
