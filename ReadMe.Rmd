This repo contains the data files, code books, and R code required to produce the statistics and graphics included in the "Best States for Blacks in Tech" report. It also contains the R-markdown code that generated the report, and it contains the report's HTML version produced by knitr's conversion of the R-markdown. In other words, the repo contains all of the resources required to make the report "reproducible" for anyone interested in replicating its findings and/or extending them to other states, adding/deleting variables, comparing them to census data from previous time frames, etc, etc, etc.

The scripts and their embedded functions should be run in numerical order: Data-1 creates the dataframe required by Stats-2; Stats-2 creates the objects and stats required for Graphs-3; and the Report-4 script needs the output of all of the above
