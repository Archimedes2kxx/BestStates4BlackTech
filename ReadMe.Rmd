This repo contains the data files, code books, and R code required to produce the tables, maps, graphs, and stats included in the "Best States for Blacks and Hispanics in Tech" report. It also contains the R-markdown code that generated the report and knitr's conversion of the markdown to an HTML format. In other words, the repo should contain all of the resources required to make the report "reproducible" for anyone interested in replicating its findings and/or extending them to other states, adding/deleting variables, comparing them to census data from previous time frames, etc, etc, etc.

The scripts and their embedded functions should be run in numerical order: Data-1A.R, and Data-1B.R create the dataframes required by Stats-2.R; Stats-2.R creates the objects required for the Report-3.Rmd R-markdown script 

The repo contains two files whose names begin with "Notes-" prefix. One provides a detailed click-by-click description of the procedure I used to download the sample ACS PUMS data for 2014 used by the Data-1A.R file. The other covers other issues I encountered and the solutions I implemented, including a click-by-click description of my download procedure for obtaining the data for the Data-1B.R script.
