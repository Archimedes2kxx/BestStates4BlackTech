To Do List

1. Revise Notes to delete use of Fact Finder ... all data from DataFerret now

2. Note describing breaking scripts into small segments to minimize to give focus to each segment and minimize damage caused by accidental changes in code ... putting functions into library will reduce damage by accidental key slips

3. Note describing future version that would compare state distribution of all groups in 2010 vs state distribution of groups in 2015

4. Interactive version, Shiny app, that displays  profiles of each state for each group (white, black, asian, hispanic, female, foreign asian, foreign non-asian) for 2010 or 2015 … then calculates changes, percent changes for focal group … interactive, i.e, tables generated real time. Need more extensive Census samples because current data yields missing values for more in-depth analysis

5. Data-1A, 1B, and Stats-2A contain lots of ugly, repetitive junk code ... extract functions and place functions in the functions-0 library ==> clean scripts

6. Future reports ... Best States for Black, Hispanic, Asian, female ==> doctors, lawyers, engineers, physical sciences, biosciences, etc, etc, etc

7. Functions
    a) top row sums and or percentages
