To Do List

1. Note describing use of total population for states in parity denominators because Fact Finder table I used did not all me to identify citizens vs. non-citizens … One correction would be to subtract all the number of foreign techs in each state from the total population … but I think total population also includes other foreigners (including illegals) so foreign techs would be probably be a small correction that would still leave larger non-citizen components in the state population … In other words the parity ratios are probably lower than reality of citizenTechs / citizenPopulation

2. Note describing breaking scripts into small segments to minimize to give focus to each segment and minimize damage caused by accidental changes in code

3. Note describing future version that would compare state distribution of all groups in 2010 vs state distribution of groups in 2015

4. Interactive version, Shiny app, that displays  profiles of each state for each group (white, black, asian, hispanic, female, foreign asian, foreign non-asian) for 2010 or 2015 … then calculates changes, percent changes for focal group … interactive, i.e, tables generated real time. Need more extensive Census samples because current data yields missing values for more in-depth analysis

5. Provide missing comments for
Table 3E
Table 3F
Table 3G
table 4G
Map 4G
Map 4H
