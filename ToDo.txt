To Do List

1. Note describing use of total population for states in parity denominators because Fact Finder table I used did not all me to identify citizens vs. non-citizens … One correction would be to subtract all the number of foreign techs in each state from the total population … but I think total population also includes other foreigners (including illegals) so foreign techs would be probably be a small correction that would still leave larger non-citizen components in the state population … In other words the parity ratios are probably lower than reality of citizenTechs / citizenPopulation

2. Note describing breaking scripts into small segments to minimize to give focus to each segment and minimize damage caused by accidental changes in code

3. Note describing future version that would compare state distribution of all groups in 2010 vs state distribution of groups in 2015
