## Revise to reflect expansion to 50 states plus DC ... and the changes in findings from this expansin 

### A. Overview 
This note presents the results of my examination of the employment of Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Whites in the tech sector in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. As the reader will see, my principal findings are straight-forward:   

* First, the percentage of tech employees who are Black is higher in states that have larger Black populations and smaller in states that have smaller Black populations. The same relationship between population size and percentage of tech employment also holds true for Hispanics, Asians, and Whites 

* Second, if all other things were equal, as economists like to say, one would expect that the percentage of employment in a state's tech sector that was Black would be the same as the percentage of the total population in the state that was Black. One would would have similar expectations for the percentage of Hispanic, Asian, and White employment in a state's tech sector. Unfortunately, all of things not being equal, I found that the percentage of every state's tech sector that was Black, Hispanic, or White was always less than the percentage of the state's total population that was Black, Hispanic, or White. By contrast I found that the percentage of every state's tech sector that was Asian was two to five times the size of the percentage of the state's total population that was Asian.

### B. Methods
I downloaded the most recent data from the American Community Survey from U.S. Census Bureau's <b>[TheDataWeb](http://thedataweb.rm.census.gov/index.html)</b> site. My step-by-step download procedure is described in <b>[Appendix #1](https://github.com/Archimedes2kxx/BestStatesForBlackTech/blob/19bc4ca9628ce050805510ffa1dbf3fdd2103a68/Appendix-1.Rmd)</b> in the report's repo on GitHub. 

To be specific, I used the Census Bureau's <b>[Data Ferret App](http://dataferrett.census.gov/LaunchDFA.html)</b> app to download sample data for 2014 for race and thirteen specified occupations for six states into a file called <b>[Race-CA-DC-GA-NC-NY-WA-Occupation-PUMS-2014.csv](Race-CA-DC-GA-NC-NY-WA-Occupation-PUMS-2014.csv)</b> in the report's repo. The data for these categories was coded, so I downloaded the ACS codebook. A <b>[copy of the codebook](https://github.com/Archimedes2kxx/BestStatesForBlackTech/blob/ee64520f2e672b0919b4e6320154fdd1d43115f6/Race-CA-DC-GA-NC-NY-WA-Occupation-PUMS-2014-CodeBook.txt)</b> will also be found in the repo.

* Race = Black, White, and Asian 
* States = All 50 states plus the District of Columbia (a "city state"), 
* Occupations (using "standard" category names) = COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS, CMM-SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS, APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEMS SOFTWARE, CMM-COMPUTER SYSTEMS ANALYSTS, ENG-ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS, CMM-COMPUTER SUPPORT SPECIALISTS, CMM-NETWORK AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATORS, CMM-COMPUTER OCCUPATIONS, ALL OTHER, CMM-COMPUTER NETWORK ARCHITECTS, CMM-DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS, CMM-WEB DEVELOPERS, ENG-COMPUTER HARDWARE ENGINEERS, CMM-INFORMATION SECURITY ANALYSTS, CMM-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION RESEARCH SCIENTISTS  

I wrote a few object-oriented scripts and functions in R to download the data and derive the percentages and graphs that are displayed in the next section. The DataFerret's sample (r numSampleObservations observations) was large enough to assume that the Black, White, and Asian percentages calculated for tech occupations for the sample would be good estimates of the actual percentages of Blacks, Whites, and Asians in tech occupations for the selected states. My R code for downloading the data, calculating the stats, and producing the graphs can be found in the Data-1.R, StatsGraphs-2.R, and Report-3.R files in the <b>[repo](https://github.com/Archimedes2kxx/BestStatesForBlackTech)</b>. The entire report was composed in R-Markdown using R-Studio, converted to HTML via knitr, then copied and pasted onto a blank page on the DLL's <b>[Tech-Levers](http://hbcu-levers.blogspot.com/p/draft-of-best-states-for-blacks-in-tech.html)</b> blog. 

The scripts and their embedded functions should be run in numerical order: Data-1 creates the dataframe required by Stats-2; Stats-2 creates the objects and stats required for Graphs-3; and the Report-4 script needs the output of all of the above.
  
### C. Findings

* Create table of percentages of White vs. Asian vs. Blacks in each state ... Table #2
* Include the statistic table for Blacks plus a ggplot of the blacks in tech vs blacks in total population ... Table #3 and Graph

### D. Conclusions 
My report's finding are mundane, but useful reminders of the futility of impatience. There is an understandable tendency for activists to demand that Blacks achieve parity with Black population levels in all of the important sectors of our society RIGHT NOW!!! Unfortunately the evil legacy of centuries of slavery and decades of Jim Crow could not be wiped out in ten, twenty, forty, or even sixty years after the Supreme Court (1954) and Congress (1964,1964) made discrimination in education and the workplace illegal. Indeed, the most incidious component of the legacy is the unwillingness of the larger society to move faster.

Perhaps the biggest lesson of the last 60 years is that we can't do it all RIGHT NOW; so we have to focus. Some #DiversityInTech activists have focused on Web pages or social media because this is where tech is  now. I suggest that we apply Wayne Gretzky's wisdom He advised hockey players not to skate to the place where the puck was at now, but where it was about to be. In the case of tech, I suggest that we encourage Black young techs to acquire the skills that will enable them to compete in the places where tech is moving towards, specifically machine learning and related AI technologies. That's why we have to continue to keep pressure on Silicon Valley, California, and Waashington state

Finally, focusing on the gap between Blacks and Whites and/or Blacks and Asians says the glass is still half-empty. But this pessimistic perspective ignores the substantial numbers of Blacks who have achieved substantial careers in tech during the last 60 years. Seeing the glass as half-full also encourages young Black techs who are just starting their careers to identify the existing networs of Black techs who can become very useful mentors and references.
