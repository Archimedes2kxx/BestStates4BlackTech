## Overview   

Top managers claim that American firms in the U.S. technology sector employ foreign professionals because they cannot find enough qualified American techs in the domestic job pipelines. This supplement uses Census data to estimate the employment of foreign techs in the 50 states plus the District of Columbia in 2015 and to estimate the increase in the employment of foreign techs between 2010 and 2015.  

<i>Please note that all of the numbers in this overview and in the subsequent sections of this supplement are estimates based on U.S. Census survey samples. Accordingly all numbers should be read as "approximately" even when the word "approximately" does not appear. </i>  

* In 2015, there were approximately `r prettyNum(dfTable1C["Num", "Total"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` professionals in the U.S. tech sector; `r prettyNum(dfTable1C["Num", "Citizens"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` were Americans (`r prettyNum(dfTable1C["Per", "Citizens"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent); `r prettyNum(dfTable1C["Num", "Foreign"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` were foreign (`r prettyNum(dfTable1C["Per", "Foreign"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent, Table 1C). Approximately `r prettyNum(dfTable1E["Num", "Asian"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` of foreign techs were females from Asian countries; `r prettyNum(dfTable1E["Num", "NonAsian"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` were females from non-Asian countries (Table 1E).   

* In 2015 approximately `r prettyNum(dfTable2C["Per", "Male"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`% of foreign techs were male; `r prettyNum(dfTable2C["Per", "Female"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`% were female; `r prettyNum(dfTable2C["Per", "FemAsian"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`% of foreign techs were female techs who came from Asian countries; and `r prettyNum(dfTable2C["Per", "FemNonAsian"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`% were female techs from non-Asian countries. (Chart 4 and Table 2C)

  <img src="ggChart4.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;" />
  
* More than half, i.e., `r prettyNum(dfTable4.1[1, "perTop6"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent, of foreign techs were concentrated in six states (Chart 5 and Table 4.1) -- California (`r prettyNum(dfTable4.1[1, "California"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`), Texas (`r prettyNum(dfTable4.1[1, "Texas"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`), New York (`r prettyNum(dfTable4.1[1, "New York"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`), New Jersey (`r prettyNum(dfTable4.1[1, "New Jersey"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`), Washington ( `r prettyNum(dfTable4.1[1, "Washington"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`), and Illinois (`r prettyNum(dfTable4.1[1, "Illinois"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`). These states also experienced the largest increases in the employment of foreign techs between 2010 and 2015 (Chart 5 and Table 4.1).

  <img src="ggChart5.png" style="width:600px;height:300px;" />

* Employment of foreign techs in the 50 states plus the District of Columbia increased by `r prettyNum(dfTable3EE[1, "perCh"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent between 2010 and 2015 (Table 3EE). By contrast, employment of American techs only increased by `r prettyNum(dfTable3ZZ[1, "perCh"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent (Table 3ZZ) during that time frame.

* In recent years cloud computing and machine learning became principal drivers in the expansion of the U.S. tech sector during the last five years. Therefore contrasts between the increase in American vs. foreign tech employment in three job categories are especially noteworthy -- software developers, database administrators, and computer/research scientists.  

* American firms increased their employment of foreign software developers from `r prettyNum(dfTable3EE[dfTable3EE$Occupation=="SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "Tech10"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` in 2010 to `r prettyNum(dfTable3EE[dfTable3EE$Occupation=="SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` in 2015, i.e., a `r prettyNum(dfTable3EE[dfTable3EE$Occupation=="SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "perCh"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent increase (Table 3EE). American firms increased their employment of American software developers by only `r prettyNum(dfTable3ZZ[dfTable3ZZ$Occupation=="SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "perCh"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent between 2010 and 2015 (Table 3ZZ)

* American firms increased their employment of foreign database administrators from `r prettyNum(dfTable3EE[dfTable3EE$Occupation=="DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS", "Tech10"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` in 2010 to `r prettyNum(dfTable3EE[dfTable3EE$Occupation=="DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` in 2015, i.e, a `r prettyNum(dfTable3EE[dfTable3EE$Occupation=="DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS", "perCh"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent increase (Table 3EE).  American firms increased their employment of American database admiistrators by only `r prettyNum(dfTable3ZZ[dfTable3ZZ$Occupation=="DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS", "perCh"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent between 2010 and 2015 (Table 3ZZ)

* American firms increased their employment of foreign computer/research scientists from `r prettyNum(dfTable3EE[dfTable3EE$Occupation=="COMP/INFO RSRCH SCIENTISTS", "Tech10"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` in 2010 to `r prettyNum(dfTable3EE[dfTable3EE$Occupation=="COMP/INFO RSRCH SCIENTISTS", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` in 2015, i.a., a `r prettyNum(dfTable3EE[dfTable3EE$Occupation=="COMP/INFO RSRCH SCIENTISTS", "perCh"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent increase (Table 3EE).  American firms increased their employment of American computer/research scientists by only `r prettyNum(dfTable3ZZ[dfTable3ZZ$Occupation=="COMP/INFO RSRCH SCIENTISTS", "perCh"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent between 2010 and 2015 (Table 3ZZ)  

* In 2015 California employed the largest number of foreign techs in all three categories ==> software developers = `r prettyNum(dfTable3G[dfTable3G$Occupation=="SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS" & dfTable3G$State=="California", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`; database administrators = `r prettyNum(dfTable3G[dfTable3G$Occupation=="DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS" & dfTable3G$State=="California", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`; and computer/research scientists = `r prettyNum(dfTable3G[dfTable3G$Occupation=="COMP/INFO RSRCH SCIENTISTS" & dfTable3G$State=="California", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`. California also recruited the largest increases in foreign techs between 2010 and 2015 ==> software developers =  `r prettyNum(dfTable3G[dfTable3G$Occupation=="SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS" & dfTable3G$State=="California", "Change"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`,  database administrators =  `r prettyNum(dfTable3G[dfTable3G$Occupation=="DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS" & dfTable3G$State=="California", "Change"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`, and computer/research scientists =  `r prettyNum(dfTable3G[dfTable3G$Occupation=="COMP/INFO RSRCH SCIENTISTS" & dfTable3G$State=="California", "Change"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` (Table 3G)

These estimates of substantial employment of foreign techs in 2015 and substantial increases in the employment of foreign techs between 2010 and 2015 were consistent with managers' claims that they were using foreign job pipelines to cover shortfalls in the availability of qualified American techs in the domestic job pipelines. 

But it must be noted that substantial increases in the employment of foreign techs were also consistent with an alternative interpretation, i.e., that American managers were importing foreign labor because it was cheaper than American labor. In other words domestic job pipelines did not contain enough American techs who were willing to work for the lower salaries that were acceptable to foreign techs. This is not to say that foreign techs were paid salaries that were below the salary ranges paid to American techs, merely that larger numbers of foreign techs were willing to work for salaries that were at the lower end of the salary ranges offered to American techs.

## Findings   

Brief answers to the first three sets of questions provide a broad statistical framwork for the extended responses to the fourth question that forms the core of this supplement.   

<i>Please note that the tables, maps, and charts in this supplement about foreign techs have been assigned numbers that follow the numbers of similar tables, maps, and charts in the original report about American techs. For example, Tables 3E and 3F appear in ths supplement because Tables 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D appeared in the original. On the other hand a few tables from the original are repeated in this supplement as convenient references for the reader and are assigned the same numbers as in the original; for example, Tables 1C and 1E.</i>

#### Question 1 -- How many foreign professionals worked in the U.S. tech sector in 2015?

<i>Answer 1C</i> ...As can be seen from Table 1C (below), `r dfTable1C["Per", "Foreign"]` percent of the U.S. tech sector in 2015 were foreign professionals.  

<b>Table 1C -- American and Foreign Components of the U.S. Tech Sector in 2015</b>    
```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, comment=NA}
   print(dfTable1C, row.names=TRUE, quote=FALSE)
```

<i>Question 1E</i> -- How many Asian and non-Asian foreign employees were in U.S. tech in the 50 states plus the District of Columbia in 2015? 

<i>Answer 1E</i> ...  As per Table 1E (below), there were almost three times as many foreign professionals from Asian countries as from other countries in U.S. tech in 2015.
  
<b>Table 1E -- Foreign Asian and Non-Asian Components of the U.S. Tech Sector in 2015</b>

#### Question 3 -- How did the foreign shares of jobs in U.S. tech change between 2010 and 2015?    


The tables in this section display profiles of the foreign professionals employed by U.S. tech. 

This supplement defined "information technology" by using the same thirteen standard occupation categories (SOC) as in the original report. Twelve related to software, e.g., Software Developers and Computer Programmers; one related to hardware, i.e., Computer Hardware Engineers.     

The first column of each table contains a list of job categories. Some categories were abbreviated to enable the rows of the table to be short enough to appear on the same line. Abbreviations include "Comp" for "Computer"; "Info" for "Information"; and "Net" for "Network". Column headings were also abbreviated as follows:   

* <b>Tech10</b> ... the number of tech workers in each job category in 2010   

* <b>Tech15</b> ... the number of tech workers in each job category in 2015   

* <b>perTS</b> ... the "Percentage of Tech Share", which shows the percentage of the total number of American tech workers that were employed in each job category in the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. For example, in Table 3Z (below) the `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` workers in "Software Development" represented `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "perTS"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent of the `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["All Occupations", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` total American tech workers in 2015. The `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["COMP PROGRAMMERS", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` workers "Computer Programmers" were `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["COMP PROGRAMMERS", "perTS"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent of the total `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["All Occupations", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`.   

* <b>Fem</b> ... the number of "Female" tech workers". The number of males can be calculated by substracting the female workers from the total number of workers in each category. For example, in Table 3Z (below) there were `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` American software developers in the 50 states plus DC in 2015 of which `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "Fem"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` were female. So the number of male software developers was `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` - `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "Fem"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` = `r prettyNum((dfTable3Z["SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "Tech15"] - dfTable3Z["SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "Fem"]), big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`. 

* <b>perF15</b> ... the "Percent Female in 2015" displays the percent of jobs in each category that were held by female techs in 2015. For example, Table 3Z shows that the `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "Fem"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` female software developers were `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "perF15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)` percent of the total `r prettyNum(dfTable3Z["SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS", "Tech15"], big.mark=",", scientific=FALSE)`

* <b>perF10</b> ... the "Percent Female in 2010" displays the percent of jobs in each category that were held by female techs in 2010. This stat is always contained in the companion table, e.g., Table 3ZZ.

* <b>Change</b> ... the difference between the number of workers in each job category in 2010 and the number in 2015. This stat is always found in the companion table, e.g., Table 3ZZ. 

* <b>perCh</b> ... the change from 2010 to 2015 as a percentage of the jobs in 2010.

## Appendix -- Job Profiles of Foreign Professionals in Big Six Tech States in 2015

As per Table 4 in the supplement, the six states in this appendix employed the largest number of Americans in their tech sectors -- California, Texas, New York, Florida, Virginia, and Illinois. This appendix displays job profiles of the foreign techs employed by each of these states. Two pairs of tables are included for each state.

* The first pair of tables displays job profiles of all foreign techs; the second pair of tables display job profiles for foreign techs from Asia

* The first table in each pair shows the distribution of foreign techs in the 13 job catebories in 2015; the second table in each pair shows the growth or decline of foreign techs in each job category between 2010 and 2015.   

In a future version of the supplement, this Appendix will be replaced by an interactive dashboard that will allow users to display pairs of tables for any state of the fifty states and DC, and for any American or foreign group.   

<i>Note: The column headings and abbreviated row names of the tables in this appendix are explained in the answer to [<b>Question 3](https://archimedes2kxx.github.io/BestStatesForBlackTech/Supplement-3.html#question-3-how-did-the-foreign-shares-of-jobs-in-u.s.-tech-change-between-2010-and-2015)</b> in the body of the supplement</i>
