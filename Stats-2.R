### Generate tables and graphics to be included in report based on the data from Data-1A and Data-2B

### Table 1. How many Techs in the US? How many total, white, black, asian, and hispanic techs in U.S.

### Maps 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D ... maps of total, white, black, asian, and hispanic techs in U.S.

### Tables 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D ... shares of tech employmnet for white, black, asian, and hispanic techs sorted in order of decreasing shares for each group .... allow identification of "top 10" in terms of most jobs for racial groups

### Maps 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D ... maps of shares of tech employment for white, black, asian, and hispanic techs

### Tables 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D ... parity ratios, i.e., tech share/populaton shares for white, black, asian, and hispanic sorted in decreasing order for each groups

### Maps 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D ... maps of parity ratios for each racial group

### Tables 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D ... regressions of Betas for racial shares of tech vs. racial shares of population for whites, blacks, asians, and hispanics ... show that a 1 percent increase in share of pop yields an X percent increase in share of tech employment ... sorted in order of decreasing size of ratios ... enable picking the 10 fairest states

### Plots 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D ... regression lines for racial shares of tech vs. racial shares of population whose slopes are the Betas in Tables 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D
